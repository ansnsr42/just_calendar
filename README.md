# ðŸ“… Java Calendar Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Build a GUI-based calendar application in Java that supports local event management using SQLite. 

## ðŸ§° Technologies

- **Language:** Java 
- **GUI Toolkit:** Swing
- **Database:** SQLite

## ðŸ—ƒ Database

The calendar application uses **SQLite** to store event data persistently. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database that stores data in a local file, making it a great fit for a desktop application like this.

### Database Structure

The database consists of a single table, `events`, with the following columns:

- **id** (INTEGER): A unique identifier for each event (Primary Key).
- **title** (TEXT): The title or name of the event.
- **date** (TEXT): The date of the event (formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **time** (TEXT): The time of the event (formatted as `HH:MM`).
- **description** (TEXT): A short description or additional details about the event.
