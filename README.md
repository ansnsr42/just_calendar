# ðŸ“… Java Calendar Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Build a GUI-based calendar application in Java that supports local event management using SQLite. 

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

| Tool  | Minimum version | Check command        |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| JDK   | **17** or newer | `java -version`      |
| Maven | **3.9**         | `mvn -version`       |

## ðŸš€ Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ansnsr42/just_calendar.git
cd just_calendar

# 2. Build and run
mvn clean package     # compiles into target/
mvn exec:java         # launches the calendar

```
## ðŸ§° Technologies

- **Language:** Java 
- **GUI Toolkit:** Swing
- **Database:** SQLite

## ðŸ—ƒ Database

The calendar application uses **SQLite** to store event data persistently. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database that stores data in a local file, making it a great fit for a desktop application like this.

### Database Structure

The database consists of a single table, `events`, with the following columns:

- **id** (INTEGER): A unique identifier for each event (Primary Key).
- **title** (TEXT): The title or name of the event.
- **date** (TEXT): The date of the event (formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **time** (TEXT): The time of the event (formatted as `HH:MM`).
- **description** (TEXT): A short description or additional details about the event.

# ðŸ§© Planned Class Structure

## `CalendarApp`

- **Type:** Main class  
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Starts the application
  - Initializes GUI and database setup

---

## `DatabaseManager`

- **Type:** Utility class  
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Manage database connection
  - Perform CRUD operations for events

- **Planned Methods:**

  ```java
  void connect();
  void addEvent(Event e);
  List<Event> getEventsForDate(LocalDate date);
  void deleteEvent(int id);
  ```

---

## `Event`

- **Type:** Plain Old Java Object (POJO)  
- **Fields:**

  ```java
  int id;
  String title;
  LocalDate date;
  LocalTime time;
  String description;
  ```

- **Responsibilities:** Stores event data

---

## `EventDialog`

- **Type:** GUI component (`JDialog`)  
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Input form for adding or editing an event
  - Validate input and pass data to `DatabaseManager`

---

## `CalendarView`

- **Type:** GUI component (`JPanel`)  
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Display monthly calendar view
  - Allow date selection and visualize events
