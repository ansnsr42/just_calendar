# ðŸ“… Java Calendar Project â€“ Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Build a GUI-based calendar application in Java that supports local event management using SQLite. This project serves as a learning platform for Java, Swing, and database integration.

## ðŸ§° Technologies

- **Language:** Java 
- **GUI Toolkit:** Swing
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Project Type:** Standalone desktop application


## ðŸ—ƒ Database

The calendar application uses **SQLite** to store event data persistently. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database that stores data in a local file, making it a great fit for a desktop application like this.

### Database Structure

The database consists of a single table, `events`, with the following columns:

- **id** (INTEGER): A unique identifier for each event (Primary Key).
- **title** (TEXT): The title or name of the event.
- **date** (TEXT): The date of the event (formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **time** (TEXT): The time of the event (formatted as `HH:MM`).
- **description** (TEXT): A short description or additional details about the event.

The table will be created automatically if it doesn't already exist when the application first runs.

SQL Statement to Create the Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    date TEXT NOT NULL,
    time TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);
```
